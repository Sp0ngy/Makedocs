Nowadays all of the legal health insurances provide apps to track medical health records of patients (apps are called ePA) but come at extremly high cost of usability, intuitivity and easy-to-use because of the often unspecific and tough requirements related to dataprotection made by german government. Thus the the government started a new try to establish the ePA and gain acceptance within the popultion till end of 2024.nts and clients with a high health interest, CSC needs to process, store and administirate electronic health records of patient at all time of provision of service. At this point, mostly the management of patient data is done manually. A software solution which is designed on the business processes of CSC helps to improve the quality of the service for the patients and improves data security, reduces human mistakes and opens chances for future advanced software-supported health service, such as analysis of treatment times.
