>Summary of the problem (from the perspective of the user), the context, suggested solution, and the stakeholders.

Germany introduced ePA in 2021 with minor too no success on establishing the system widespread within the landscape of legal health insurance. Nowadays all of the legal health insurances provide apps to track medical health records of patients (apps are called ePA) but come at extremly high cost of usability, intuitivity and easy-to-use because of the often unspecific and tough requirements related to dataprotection made by german government. Thus the the government started a new try to establish the ePA and gain acceptance within the popultion till end of 2024.nts and clients with a high health interest, CSC needs to process, store and administirate electronic health records of patient at all time of provision of service. At this point, mostly the management of patient data is done manually. A software solution which is designed on the business processes of CSC helps to improve the quality of the service for the patients and improves data security, reduces human mistakes and opens chances for future advanced software-supported health service, such as analysis of treatment times. The solution will be strucutred in 3 stages:

### Phase 1  
- Health data platform for the management, storage and processing of medical  
events (e.g. blood count, CT scan, physician consultation) of a client with focus on storage of original data (e.g. blood count: scanned laboratory findings, CT scan: DICOM data and scanned  
findings, doctor's consultation: Physician's letter)  
- Automatic creation of individual, year-based preventive care plans as well as tracking of the implementation of the of the clients' preventive measures  

### Phase 2  
- Integration of a ticket system with networking of an international network of medical specialists for fast mediation of second opinions from designated specialists  
- Uniform interface for simplified transmission of medical events for third parties  

### Phase 3  
- Mobile applications for clients to view and manage their own medical record and  
tracking of preventive measures
